## GraphQL Ambassador Program

The following is an overview of the proposed GraphQL Ambassador Program for the
organizers (the Foundation, community working group and other interested
parties) outlining the goals, outcomes and tasks of the program.

### Ambassador Initiative Goals

The overarching goal is to increase GraphQL adoption. The Ambassador Program
aims to accomplish this through:

- Brand advocacy - developers organically vouch for and promote GraphQL
- Social proof - named individuals with high visibility (and a proportion from
  known corporate brands) as Ambassadors
- Increased GraphQL content online and off
- Community building - increasing the number of “known faces” within GraphQL,
  increased approachability and a welcoming environment to spread knowledge
  about GraphQL

There are also benefits to the Ambassador:

- Professional recognition as a GraphQL expert
- Access to other GraphQL experts, both in their local community and online
- Closer relationship with the GraphQL Foundation & project, including
  up-to-date news and insights on upcoming Specification edits and working group
  topics

### Ambassador Requirements

- Highly knowledgeable about GraphQL and readily able to articulate those ideas
- Be a model community member: Adhering to the standards of excellence
  especially when critical of GraphQL or defending it to others criticism,
  remaining respectful, constructive and fair
- Do not come across to other community members as selling another product,
  service or agenda when acting as an ambassador
- Already participating in one or more of the Ambassador Tasks outlined below
- Agree to have their face, name, chosen socials and other relevant information
  displayed on the "people"/"ambassadors" page

### Ambassador Tasks

GraphQL Ambassadors will be an important touchstone for people interested in
GraphQL to learn more about it in a friendly and constructive way.

They will do four or more ambassador tasks throughout their one year term. They
can do the same task four times, or a mixture of tasks.

Ambassador tasks include:

    - Have actively maintained a GraphQL project or reference implementation

  direction of the project and an opportunity for Q&A
  - 15 minute presentation-style
  - followed by Q&A
  - time also allowed for the Foundation / TSC reps to ask for the Ambassadors'
    feedback on the current directions of the GraphQL project, be that technical
    (eg Specification RFCs), or community initiative focused
- Promotion of the Ambassador as a go-to GraphQL community leader
  - Website profile
  - Biographies / interviews with each Ambassador
  - Credly badge
- An Ambassador role on the community Discord and an associated private channel
  for networking and discussions with Foundation / TSC / community reps
- Promotion of Ambassador material - conference talk videos and created content
- Exclusive GraphQL swag eg Ambassador hoodie
- Free GraphQL Foundation Conference ticket
- Ambassadors may apply for travel funding to approved conference & meetup
  talks, applications to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
- An honorarium available for content creation on a case-by-case basis

### Ambassador Standards of Excellence

While the wider GraphQL community abides by the
[contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/),
stronger set of standards is needed for the Ambassador Program. This is because
the Foundation will be endorsing these people as representatives and experts. We
can look to the
[CNCF Ambassador Program Standards of Excellence](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/program-standards/)
as a good indicator of what this should be. The beginnings of a document is
here, see [standards-of-excellence.md](./standards-of-excellence.md)

### Process

#### Application Process

Yearly program

- 1 year term

  - Applications open year round
  - Applications received by a group email address and should be acknowledged
    swiftly
  - Applications to be considered by TSC members, select Foundation members and
    select community working group members. Once we have the first cohort of
    Ambassadors accepted, Ambassadors themselves can also consider the
    applications.
  - Applicants need at least one approval, any objections are to be
    investigated.
  - A new wave of Ambassadors announced quarterly. The first announcement we are
    hoping can coincide with the GraphQL Conference in September 2025.

- Applications can be from the prospective Ambassador or a nomination from a
  community member.
- Foundation members will be asked to nominate an Ambassador from within their
  organization, and to nominate a second Ambassador from outside their
  organization
- TSC members will be invited to apply when they are welcomed to the TSC
- The Ambassador term is a year long, Ambassadors who continue to meet the
  expectations will be invited to join again at the end of their term

#### Removal of an Ambassador

- The Ambassador term is a year long, this gives a natural end to a person's
  Ambassador role
- If the Ambassador is found to be breaking the
  [standards-of-excellence.md](./standards-of-excellence.md), the GraphQL Code
  of Conduct or the Linux Foundation Events Code of Conduct, the Ambassador role
  may be removed before the end of their term. The Ambassador Program organizers
  will engage with the Linux Foundation for this process as needed.

#### Travel expenses

- Wait for the talk to be accepted through the meetup CfP process
- Review the talk proposal to ensure alignment with the Program
- Can the payment be made beforehand rather than in arrears?

#### Honorarium for content creation

- Ambassador applies for an honorarium each time, in a process similar to the
  Community Grant
- There will be a maximum yearly amount available, paid from the Marketing
  budget
- We should publish a guide to the amounts available (once this is agreed)
- A revision process is expected

### Offboarding and Alumni Network

Upon completing a successful term, Ambassadors join our Alumni Network:

- Continued Ambassador Discord channel to answer questions from new Ambassadors.
- Priority CFP notifications for GraphQL Foundation events
- Annual Alumni spotlight blog series
- What else to include here?
