## GraphQL Ambassador Program

The following is the beginnings of a document outlining the goals, outcomes and tasks of an Ambassador program. 
 

### Ambassador Initiative Goals

The overarching goal is to increase GraphQL adoption. The Ambassadors program aims to accomplish this through:

* Brand advocacy - developers organically vouch for and promote GraphQL
* Social proof - named individuals with high visibility (and a proportion from known corporate brands) as Ambassadors
* Increased GraphQL content online and off
* Community building - increase the number of “known faces” within GraphQL, increased approachability (addressing the concern of “lowering the barrier to join an inclusive GraphQL community” raised by the Community WG)  

How can these goals be measured? 

* Engagement metrics - social, chat channels, search, downloads, page views…
* New community members (across social media comments, Discord users, local gathering attendees, working group members…) 
* Volume of talks at conferences
* Volume of articles written

### Ambassador Tasks

As a GraphQL Ambassador, you will be an important touchstone for people interested in GraphQL to learn more about it in a friendly and constructive way. 

One or more of the following:

* Conference & meetup talks on GraphQL
* Local gathering organization
* Written GraphQL content
* Video / audio GraphQL content
* Building demo apps
* Mentorship hours
* Community Discord moderation
* Cross-project collaboration with open source projects outside of the GraphQL GitHub organization

### Foundation Tasks

* Quarterly meeting with the Foundation / TSC reps to give updates about the general direction of the project and an opportunity for Q&A
    * 15 minute presentation-style  
    * followed by Q&A  
* Ambassadors may apply for travel funding to approved conference & meetup talks, applications to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
* Microgrant (or honorarium) available for content creation on GraphQL Foundation platforms
    * Where is this content hosted?  
        * Where ever the Ambassador is comfortable:- 
            * Personal blog / website
            * GraphQL Foundation platform (blog, youtube, etc)
            * Third party platform (dev.to, Medium, LinkedIn etc)
* Promotion of Ambassador material - conference talk videos and created content
* Promotion of the Ambassador as a go-to GraphQL expert
    * Website profile
    * Longer task: biographies / interviews with each Ambassador
    * Credly badge
* An Ambassador role on the community Discord and an associated private channel for networking and discussions with Foundation / TSC / community reps
* Exclusive GraphQL swag eg Ambassador hoodie

### Ambassador Requirements

* Highly knowledgeable about GraphQL and readily able to articulate those ideas 
* Be a model community member: Adhering to the code of conduct especially when critical of GraphQL or defending it to others criticism, remaining respectful, constructive and fair 
* Do not come across to other community members as selling another product, service or agenda


### Ambassador Code of Conduct

While the wider GraphQL community abides by the [contributor covenant code of conduct](https://graphql.org/codeofconduct/), we will need a stronger set of standards for the Ambassador Program. This is because the Foundation will be endorsing these people as representatives. We can look to the [CNCF Ambassador Program Standards of Excellence](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/program-standards/) as a good indicator of what this should be. In fact, we are encouraged to borrow liberally from them, as they are also a Linux Foundation project with an already successful program, and their lawyers have already signed it off. 

### Process

Yearly program
 * 1 year term 
    * Applications open year round
    * Applications considered each quarter: beginning of Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct
    * Successful applicants onboarded into program during  Feb, May, Aug, Nov
    * New wave of Ambassadors announced during Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec

How many Ambassadors is a reasonable number?  

Self-nominations and nominations from within the community; who should review these?  

Requirements to become an Ambassador
 * No set requirements as such, the section "Ambassador Requirements" above gives an idea of the type of people we are looking for
 * Some questions to go in the nomination: 
    * Briefly describe your familiarity with GraphQL. Consider including any open source projects you work on, any working groups you’ve attended, spec proposals you’ve been involved with, talks you’ve given or media you've published (books, videos, podcasts, newsletters, tutorials, blogs, etc)
    * Do you currently hold any formal leadership roles within the GraphQL ecosystem? 

Process for removing an Ambassador? And the reason to do so?  

Travel expenses for conferences & meetups: 
  * Wait for the talk to be accepted through the meetup CfP process  
  * Review the talk proposal to ensure alignment with the Program  
  * Can the payment be made beforehand rather than in arrears?   

### Offboarding and Alumni Network

Upon completing a successful term, Ambassadors join our Alumni Network:
 * Continued Ambassador Discord channel to answer questions from new Ambassadors.
 * Priority CFP notifications for GraphQL Foundation events
 * Annual Alumni spotlight blog series
 * What else to include here?
